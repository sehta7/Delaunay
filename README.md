Voronoi diagram from Delaunau teselation in Windows Forms

"Voronoi diagram is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points in a specific subset of the plane. That set of points (called seeds, sites, or generators) is specified beforehand, and for each seed there is a corresponding region consisting of all points closer to that seed than to any other. These regions are called Voronoi cells. The Voronoi diagram of a set of points is dual to its Delaunay triangulation." [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram]

Program has two main functions:

- make Delaunay teselation

- make Voronoi diagram

There is option to join this two options. Additionally we can use Laplace smoothing to get more regular grid.
